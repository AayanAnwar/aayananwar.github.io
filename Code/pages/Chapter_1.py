I woke up with a start, feeling a sharp pain in my head as well as my back. I noticed a heavy cloak on top of me (Is this mine? It doesn't... feel mine.). I tried to sit up, but as I did, I felt something soft on my chest. I looked down and noticed that on top of my heavy cloak, a few yellow, fluffy chicks were sleeping. I slowly laid back down.

<i>Where am I?</i><br>
I tried to make sense of my surroundings, so I looked around. I was in a sort of barn (there was hay on the floor), however, it was evident that there were no animals kept here, save for, perhaps, the tiny chicks.<br>
The walls were made of wood, and there was a lantern atop me, as well as a few other beds made of lumps of hay. I realized that I was lying on one of these. There was a big window opposite me (the kind with no glass), and I could see it was night-time.

<i>How did I end up here? Why am I hurt? What happened?</i><br>
I tried to recall, but nothing came to mind. I tried to remember as far back as I could, when I made a realization- <i>I don't remember my name.</i><br>
<i>What is going on? Why can't I--</i><br>
"So you're finally awake?"

I sat straight up and turned around, I could feel the chicks chirping and running away. Standing before me was a man and a woman, but I can't see any of them clearly- it's too dark. "What happened to you?", the woman inquired.<br>
I didn't say anything.<br>
"What do you recall?"<br>
"Nothing."<br>
"What's your name?"<br>
<i>I don't know...</i><br>
She stares at me (I think she does- but I can't tell.).<br>
"Do you remember anything?"<br>
I shake my head.<br>
She turns to the man next to her, and whispers something to him. The woman walks forward to me. She's wearing a lab coat stained with a bit of red (blood?), and is around 5 foot. Her hair is tied in a messy bun.<br>
"My name is Zulaya, and I was in charge of you while you were knocked out."<br>
"What happened? Why am I here?"<br>
"We were wondering the same thing."<br>
"How did you find me? What's my name?", I say- I have many questions.<br>
"It's best if you are not overloaded with information- you are recovering after all, and-"

<i>"There was an explosion."</i><br>
The icy voice travels through my body as the man steps forward.

The man is tall with pale skin and dark shoulder-length hair. He's wearing a half-black and half-white cloak, and layers of navy blue clothing underneath. He has two sheathed swords- one on his back, and one on the side of his hips. His eyes are covered with a sort of a strip of white gauze, and there is an ugly scar on the edge of his lip that has been tightly stitched together.<br>
"This is Master Snake", Zulaya offers an uncomfortably long silence.<br>
Even though his eyes are covered, he is looking straight at me.<br>
"There was an explosion a few blocks over, from a suspected Deo*, in a wheat field. There was only one death, and you were found lying unconscious beside the deceased.<br>
Do you really not remember anything?"<br>
I shake my head again.<br>
There is a short silence, broken when he says,"We didn't expect them to be prepared for you."<br>
<i>Who's we!?</i><br>
"Who's we!?", I ask loudly this time.<br>
"You... are a Shadow."<br>
<i>A what!?</i><br>
"Our organization consists of Shadows like you, people whose job is to collect information about every possible threat to this country, and counter any and all threats."<br>
<i>What is this man saying?</i>

* Deo is a Chitrali believed to be able to turn into glowing orbs of fire.
